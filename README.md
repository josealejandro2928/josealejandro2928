## Hi, I'm Jose Alejandro Concepcion Alvarez ##
###  Software Engineer | Full Stack Developer | JavaScript | Python | Java ###

I have a degree in Automation Engineering and Mechatronics. I am a Full Stack Developer with  four years of experience as a Software Developer. The main programming languages I am proficient in are JavaScript, Python, and Java. Most of the projects I have worked on were related to Web and Mobile development. I have experience in both Frontend Development and Backend Development. For user interface design and creation, the technologies with which I feel comfortable are Angular and React. On the backend side, I have experience developing API Rest using NodeJS with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I have also developed serverless functions using amazon web services. I am a person passionate about technology. I am always studying and looking for new ways to improve my skills. I'm a fan of programming, and usually, in my free time, instead of using my social networks or watching series on Netflix; I solve algorithm and data structure problems on platforms like www.leetcode.com, www.hackerrank.com, and www.algoexpert.io.


## These are the technologies I like to work with ##

#### Self-Balancing-Arduino-Robot-Controller ####
A two-wheeled self-balancing robot based on an Arduino micro controller and 12 V DC motors. A logic is implemented on top of a 
cascaded PID controller to obtain the best performance in speed and tilt control. For the user interface, a mobile application was 
developed using Ionic.
